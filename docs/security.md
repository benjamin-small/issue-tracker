# Security model

## Identity and authentication

- **Actors.** Every actor is a user: `human`, `agent` or the internal `system`. Roles are `admin` and `member` (see [api.md](api.md#authentication) for what each can do). Give every automated worker its own `agent` user, so history, events and webhooks attribute its changes.
- **API tokens** (`trk_…`, 40 random base62 characters) are shown once and stored only as SHA-256 hashes. They can expire (`expiresAt`) and be revoked (`DELETE /tokens/{id}`). `last_used_at` is updated with throttling.
- **Browser sessions** come from `POST /auth/token-login`: a random cookie, stored hashed, valid for 30 days, `HttpOnly`, `SameSite=Lax`, and `Secure` in production. `POST /auth/logout` deletes the session.
- **SSO sessions** (when `POIETIC_ISSUES_SSO_ISSUER` is set) come from `POST /auth/sso`, which verifies the issuer's JWT cookie (ES256, `iss`/`aud`/`exp`/`iat` claims) against the issuer's JWKS. The user's SSO role determines initial access: matching `POIETIC_ISSUES_SSO_ADMIN_ROLE` creates the user as an active admin; anyone else is created deactivated (answered with the `PENDING_APPROVAL` error) until an admin approves them. Signing out of the SSO provider does not end the tracker session (30 days).
- **CSRF.** Cookie-authenticated `POST`/`PATCH`/`PUT`/`DELETE` requests must come from the server's own origin or one listed in `POIETIC_ISSUES_ALLOWED_ORIGINS`. Bearer-token requests carry no ambient credentials and are exempt.
- **Credentials and anonymous access.** A request with no credentials, or with a stale, expired or unknown session cookie, is treated as anonymous: it can read public projects, and it gets 401 on anything that needs sign-in. A bearer token that is invalid, expired or revoked is different: the request fails with 401 at once and never falls back to anonymous.
- **Sign-in redirect.** The web app's `/login?next=` target is sanitised by `safeNext` (`apps/web/src/lib/safe-next.ts`): only same-origin paths starting with a single `/` are followed, and backslashes, control characters and anything that resolves to another origin become `/`. The sign-in page, the SSO return target and the "Continue without signing in" link all use the sanitised value.
- **Dev login.** `POIETIC_ISSUES_AUTH_MODE=dev` lets anyone sign in as any user, for local development only. The server refuses it when `NODE_ENV=production`.
- **Trusted mode** is the CLI's local mode. It acts as a configured user without credentials, and only runs in-process: it can never be selected for a listening server. Anyone who can open the database file or connection can do this anyway.
- **First admin.** `poietic-issues db bootstrap` creates it, and works only while no human admin exists.

## Project access

See [ADR 0021](adr/0021-project-visibility-and-roles.md).

- **Public projects are readable by anyone**, including visitors who are not signed in. That covers issues, comments, activity, attachment downloads and the live event stream. Make a project public only if everything in it, history included, may be seen by the whole internet. Webhooks are not affected.
- **Private projects return 404** (the same response as an unknown project) to everyone except their members and global admins. Errors, search and filter-name resolution never confirm that a hidden project, issue or name exists.
- **Anonymous requests are `GET` and `HEAD` only.** Everything else needs sign-in and returns 401. `/me` answers `{ anonymous: true }`. `/users`, `/users/{user}` and the token endpoints need sign-in.
- **Emails** are visible only to admins and to the user themself, including in `user.*` events. Anonymous readers see handles and names only where they are embedded in public resources, such as authors and assignees. The issue input schema (`GET /projects/{project}/schema/issue`) lists assignable handles only to signed-in callers, and only the users who can write the project.
- **Links** into projects the viewer cannot read, and the events that create them, are hidden. Creating or removing a link needs write access to one of its issues and read access to the other.
- **Deleted content needs write.** Trashed issues, deleted comments and the attachments of either are visible only to actors with `write` (or more) on the project. A deleted attachment is visible to nobody: no one can list or fetch it, and writers see only its events. Below `write`:
  - a trashed issue is not found (`NOT_FOUND`), whatever the request, and so are its comments, attachments, links and activity, including attempts to edit or delete them;
  - deleted comments and attachments of deleted comments are left out of lists, and fetching such an attachment is not found;
  - `includeDeleted` is silently ignored for projects the caller cannot write in, so one cross-project list can show trash in some projects and not in others;
  - a trashed parent is cut out of its children (`parent` and `parentId` are `null`);
  - restoring an issue makes its history visible again, because the rules follow the current state of each row.
- **The event log hides the same content.** `GET /events`, issue activity and the live stream apply these rules to readers below `write`, with the same result on replay and live:
  - events of a trashed issue are dropped, and so are link events with a trashed end;
  - events of a deleted attachment, or of one on a deleted comment, are dropped;
  - events of a deleted comment stay, with the body emptied;
  - snapshots cut a trashed parent. A parent change to a trashed issue, or from one to no parent, is left out of `changes`; a move from a trashed parent to a live one keeps the live end as `{ from: null, to }`.

  On the live stream, live and on replay, readers get `issue.deleted` and `attachment.deleted` as tombstones instead: only the issue's id and key and the attachment's id, so open views drop the row. `GET /events` and issue activity leave them out. These rules do not apply in projects the viewer can write in. Admins and webhooks (delivered as the system actor) see every event unchanged; other signed-in viewers, writers included, still have other users' emails hidden in `user.*` events and see link events only when both ends are visible to them.

- **Live streams follow access changes.** `GET /events/stream` re-reads the viewer's access when memberships or projects change. A `user.updated` event about the viewer, including their own edits, is delivered and then ends the stream, with or without `?project=`; the client refetches and reconnects with the new account state. Each connection holds at most 1,000 pending events: one more sends `reset` and closes it, and the client reconnects and refetches. Email-only `user.updated` events are not shown to other non-admin viewers. An event that ends the viewer's read access to a project (their membership removed, the project made private) is delivered without its content, so their open pages refetch and show not found, and a `?project=` stream on that project then closes. Connections with the same access share the stream's content lookups while they run, and keep nothing afterwards.
- **Open anonymous streams cost resources.** Anyone can open `GET /events/stream` on public projects without signing in. On issues.poietic.tech an open stream counts as activity, so a stream left open keeps the Cloudflare container awake and prevents it from sleeping ([deployment.md](deployment.md#cloudflare-containers-issuespoietictech)).
- **Admin-only endpoints** answer an anonymous request with 401 and a signed-in non-admin with 403.
- **Roles** (`viewer`, `editor`, `manager`) are per project. Global admins always have `manage`, and no guard stops the last manager from leaving.

## Attachments

Uploaded files are untrusted content served from the app's origin, so:

- **Type detection.** The media type comes from the file's bytes; the client's declared type is ignored. Markup (SVG, HTML) is stored as `text/plain`.
- **Inline display.** Only PNG, JPEG, GIF and WebP are served `inline`. Everything else downloads (`Content-Disposition: attachment`).
- **Response headers.** Every download carries `X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff` and `Content-Security-Policy: default-src 'none'; sandbox`.
- **Filenames** are sanitized. Storage keys are random, so the filename never becomes a path.
- **Size.** `POIETIC_ISSUES_MAX_UPLOAD_MB` limits uploads, and the body is rejected while streaming.
- **S3 presigned URLs** expire after 5 minutes and come from a different origin than the app.

## Webhooks

- **Admins only.** Only admins can create webhooks.
- **All projects, private ones included.** A webhook with no project receives the events of every project, and no per-viewer filtering applies: deliveries carry the raw events (emails, deleted content, private projects). Give a webhook's URL only to receivers you trust with the whole tracker.
- **Signing.** Each delivery is signed with a per-webhook secret (Standard Webhooks, HMAC-SHA256). Receivers should verify the signature and reject old timestamps ([events.md](events.md#verifying-signatures)).
- **SSRF guard.** Outgoing requests are restricted:
  - `https` only;
  - every resolved address must be public, and the connection is pinned to it;
  - no redirects, a 10 s timeout, and a 64 KB response cap.

  `POIETIC_ISSUES_WEBHOOK_ALLOW_PRIVATE` lifts this for development and is refused in production.

## Data handling

- **Timestamps** are UTC and generated by the application.
- **Deletes.** Issue and comment deletes are soft (restorable) unless an admin deletes permanently. Attachment deletes remove the stored bytes.
- **Event log.** The log keeps full snapshots of changed resources, so deleted content remains in history. Plan retention accordingly.
- **Secrets at rest.** Webhook secrets are stored in plain text (they are needed to sign), so protect database backups. Token and session secrets are only stored hashed.

## Reporting

This is an internal project. Report suspected vulnerabilities privately to the maintainers rather than in a public issue.

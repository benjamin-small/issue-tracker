/**
 * `GET /events/stream` — live events as Server-Sent Events.
 *
 * Each message has `id: <seq>`, `event: <type>` and the event JSON as `data`. Browsers reconnect automatically
 * and send `Last-Event-ID`; the server replays what was missed (up to 1000 events — beyond that it sends a
 * `reset` event, telling the client to refetch). Optional `?project=` filters to one project.
 *
 * The tailer fans out every event, so each connection applies its viewer's access (the same rules as
 * `GET /events`): only readable projects, and the readable set is re-read when memberships or a project's
 * visibility change. A connection with more than 1000 events waiting gets `reset` and is closed, and a viewer's
 * stream (with or without `?project=`) is closed after delivering a `user.updated` event about them; the client
 * reconnects as who they are now and resumes. Replay runs on the identity the reconnect authenticated as, so it
 * never closes the stream.
 *
 * Readers below write get `issue.deleted` and `attachment.deleted` as content-free tombstones, live and on replay,
 * so open views drop the row. An event that ends the viewer's read access to its project is delivered without its
 * content, and a `?project=` stream on that project is then closed. Connections with the same access share their
 * content lookups (`ContentRulesMemo`).
